#  Generic Frameworks & Tools

A curated collection of reusable frameworks, utilities, and developer tools—built to accelerate common engineering workflows across domains.

---

##  What This Repo Offers

This repository brings together a **suite of modular, language-agnostic building blocks** that can be applied to a variety of engineering needs—from test automation and DevOps to microservice scaffolding and internal tooling.

Each framework or tool is designed with a focus on:

-  Reusability
-  Configurability
-  Plug-and-play integration
-  Developer-first experience

---

##  What You’ll Find

- **Core Frameworks**  
  Reusable skeletons for common patterns like test runners, CLI apps, background workers, and microservices.

- **Tooling Modules**  
  Components for logging, metrics, reporting, alerts, configuration management, and error handling.

- **Utility Libraries**  
  Helper functions for date/time ops, file I/O, retries, environment validation, and more.

- **Template Generators**  
  CLI-based scaffolds for quickly bootstrapping new projects based on predefined templates.

- **Examples & Integrations**  
  Sample use cases showing how individual pieces can be stitched together or extended.

##  When to Use This

This repository is ideal for:

- Engineering teams looking to **standardize project scaffolding**
- Individual contributors wanting to **avoid repetitive boilerplate**
- Architects building **frameworks that scale across teams**
- QA & DevOps engineers setting up **consistent tooling across environments**

---

##  Design Principles

- **Modular** – Use what you need, replace what you don’t  
- **Extensible** – Plug in your own logic or tooling effortlessly  
- **Language-Agnostic** – Designed to work across ecosystems (e.g., Python, Java, Node)  
- **Minimal Setup** – Get started with just a few commands
